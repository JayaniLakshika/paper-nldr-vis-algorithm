 abstract = {We propose to furnish visual statistical methods with an inferential framework and protocol, modelled on confirmatory statistical testing. In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ' discoveries' is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the 'lineup' popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the 'Rorschach' inkblot test, well known from (pop-) psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students' statistical thinking.},

	abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, e.g., RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artefacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighbourhood and where it is not.We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using colour to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions, but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleep-walk{\textquoteright}s comparative modes help integrate multi-sample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = { High-dimensional data is ubiquitous in scientific research and industrial production fields. It brings a lot of information to people, at the same time, because of its sparse and redundancy, it also brings great challenges to data mining and pattern recognition. Dimensionality reduction can reduce redundancy and noise, reduce the complexity of learning algorithms, and improve the accuracy of classification, it is an important and key step in pattern recognition system. In this paper, we overview the classical techniques for dimensionality reduction and review their properties, and categorize these techniques according to their implementation process. We deduce each algorithm in detail and intuitively show their underlying mathematical principles. Thereby, the focus is to uncover the optimization process for each technique. We compare the characteristics and limitations of each technique and summarize the scope of application, discussing a number of open problems and a perspective of research trend in future. },

@article{collyer2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Residual randomization in permutation procedures (RRPP) is an appropriate means of generating empirical sampling distributions for ANOVA statistics and linear model coefficients, using ordinary or generalized least-squares estimation. This is an especially useful approach for high-dimensional (multivariate) data. Here, we present an r package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for applying RRPP to linear models. Important available features include choices for OLS or GLS coefficient estimation, data or dissimilarity matrix analysis capability, choice among types I, II, or III sums of squares and cross-products, various effect size estimation methods, and an ability to perform mixed-model ANOVA. The lm.rrpp function is similar to the lm function in many regards, but provides coefficient and ANOVA statistics estimates over many random permutations. The S3 generic functions commonly used with lm also work with lm.rrpp. Additionally, a pairwise function provides statistical tests for comparisons of least-squares means or slopes, among designated groups. Users have many options for varying random permutations. Compared to similar available packages and functions, RRPP is extremely fast and yields comprehensive results for downstream analyses and graphics, following model fits with lm.rrpp. The RRPP package facilitates analysis of both univariate and multivariate response data, even when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations.},

	abstract = {As basic research, it has also received increasing attention from people that the ``curse of dimensionality'' will lead to increase the cost of data storage and computing; it also influences the efficiency and accuracy of dealing with problems. Feature dimensionality reduction as a key link in the process of pattern recognition has become one hot and difficulty spot in the field of pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. It is one of the most challenging research fields, which has been favored by most of the scholars' attention. How to implement ``low loss'' in the process of feature dimension reduction, keep the nature of the original data, find out the best mapping and get the optimal low dimensional data are the keys aims of the research. In this paper, two-dimensionality reduction methods, feature selection and feature extraction, are introduced; the current mainstream dimensionality reduction algorithms are analyzed, including the method for small sample and method based on deep learning. For each algorithm, examples of their application are given and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are evaluated.},

	abstract = { Modern applications of statistical theory and methods can involve extremely large datasets, often with huge numbers of measurements on each of a comparatively small number of experimental units. New methodology and accompanying theory have emerged in response: the goal of this Theme Issue is to illustrate a number of these recent developments. This overview article introduces the difficulties that arise with high-dimensional data in the context of the very familiar linear statistical model: we give a taste of what can nevertheless be achieved when the parameter vector of interest is sparse, that is, contains many zero elements. We describe other ways of identifying low-dimensional subspaces of the data space that contain all useful information. The topic of classification is then reviewed along with the problem of identifying, from within a very large set, the variables that help to classify observations. Brief mention is made of the visualization of high-dimensional data and ways to handle computational problems in Bayesian analysis are described. At appropriate points, reference is made to the other papers in the issue. },

abstract = {To verify cluster separation in high-dimensional data, analysts often reduce the data with a dimension reduction (DR) technique, and then visualize it with 2D Scatterplots, interactive 3D Scatterplots, or Scatterplot Matrices (SPLOMs). With the goal of providing guidance between these visual encoding choices, we conducted an empirical data study in which two human coders manually inspected a broad set of 816 scatterplots derived from 75 datasets, 4 DR techniques, and the 3 previously mentioned scatterplot techniques. Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often &#x27;good enough&#x27;, that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design. Our results offer guidance to analysts during the DR exploration process.},

This effectively allows for a nonconvex or multiply connected triangulation (the complement of the union of constraint regions) while retaining the efficiency of searching and updating a convex triangulation. The package provides a wide range of capabilities including an efficient means of updating the triangulation with nodal additions or deletions.

 abstract = {We propose a rudimentary taxonomy of interactive data visualization based on a triad of data analytic tasks: finding Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations: focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization--XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking, and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections, linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots. Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking, and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by high-dimensional projections that form an extremely well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular interest are the illustration of asymptotic normality of high-dimensional projections (a theorem of Diaconis and Freedman), the use of high-dimensional cubes for visualizing factorial experiments, and a method for interactively generating matrices of conditional plots with high-dimensional projections. Although there is a unifying theme to this article, each section--in particular the case studies--can be read separately.},

It implements 2-D displays of projections of points and lines in high-dimensional spaces, as well as parallel coordinate displays and textual views thereof. Projection tools include dotplots of single variables, plots of pairs of variables, 3-D data rotations, various grand tours, and interactive projection pursuit. Views of the data can be reshaped. Points can be labeled and brushed with glyphs and colors. Lines can be edited and colored. Several XGobi processes can be run simultaneously and linked for labeling, brushing, and sharing of projections. Missing data are accommodated and their patterns can be examined; multiple imputations can be given to XGobi for rapid visual diagnostics. XGobi includes an extensive online help facility. XGobi can be integrated in other software systems, as has been done for the data analysis language S, the geographic information system (GIS) ArcView™, and the interactive multidimensional scaling program XGvis. XGobi is implemented in the X Window System™ for portability as well as the ability to run across a network.},

 abstract = {High-performance interaction with scatterplot matrices is a powerful approach to exploratory multivariate data analysis. For a small number of data points, real-time interaction is possible and overplotting is usually not a major problem. When the number of plotted points is large, however, display techniques that deal with overplotting and slow production are important. This article addresses these two problems. Topics include density representation by gray scale or by symbol area, alternatives to brushing, and animation sequences. We also discuss techniques that are generally applicable, including interactive graphical subset selection from any plot in a collection of scatterplots and comparison of scatterplot matrices.},

@article{daniel2010,
	abstract = { Scatter Plots are one of the most powerful and most widely used techniques for visual data exploration. A well-known problem is that scatter plots often have a high degree of overlap, which may occlude a significant portion of the data values shown. In this paper, we propose the generalized scatter plot technique, which allows an overlap-free representation of large data sets to fit entirely into the display. The basic idea is to allow the analyst to optimize the degree of overlap and distortion to generate the best-possible view. To allow an effective usage, we provide the capability to zoom smoothly between the traditional and our generalized scatter plots. We identify an optimization function that takes overlap and distortion of the visualization into acccount. We evaluate the generalized scatter plots according to this optimization function, and show that there usually exists an optimal compromise between overlap and distortion. Our generalized scatter plots have been applied successfully to a number of real-world IT services applications, such as server performance monitoring, telephone service usage analysis and financial data, demonstrating the benefits of the generalized scatter plots over traditional ones. },

@article{chen2023,
	abstract = {In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies, cell-types and their associated marker genes are often identified by clustering and differential expression gene (DEG) analysis. scRNA-seq data contain many genes not relevant to cell-types and gene selection procedures are needed for more accurate clustering. An ideal gene selection procedure should select all DEGs between cell-types for best cell-type identification. However, because cell-types are unknown, gene selection and DEG analysis are performed separately using different methods. Genes are selected using surrogate criteria not directly related with clustering, which often miss important genes or select unimportant genes. Clustering accuracy could be seriously influenced because of the inferior gene selection. DEGs are often detected by comparing different clusters, leading to many false DEGs due to the selection bias problem. In this paper, we present Festem, a unified method for gene selection and DEG analysis in scRNA-seq studies. Festem investigates gene{\textquoteright}s clustering information based on the observation that marginal distributions of DEGs are mixtures of their different cell-type-conditional distributions, and can directly select the clustering-informative DEGs and avoid the selection bias problem. Extensive simulation and real data analyses show that Festem achieves high precision and recall for DEG detection, and enables more accurate clustering and cell-type identification. Applications to several scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that Festem can identify cell-types that are often missed by other methods. In a large intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma dataset, we identify CD8+ T cell-types and find that their marker genes are novel prognostic biomarkers.Competing Interest StatementR.X. holds the stock of GeneX Health Co., Ltd.

Such data are widespread, including, for example, intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. MDS represents the data as distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. This map can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data matrices. MDS is also used as a psychological model for judgments of similarity and preference." "This book may be used as an introduction to MDS for students in psychology, sociology, and marketing. The prerequisite is an elementary background in statistics. The book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on MDS topics. All the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed systematically."--Jacket.},

abstract = {This survey presents multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods and their applications in real world. MDS is an exploratory and multivariate data analysis technique becoming more and more popular. MDS is one of the multivariate data analysis techniques, which tries to represent the higher dimensional data into lower space. The input data for MDS analysis is measured by the dissimilarity or similarity of the objects under observation. Once the MDS technique is applied to the measured dissimilarity or similarity, MDS results in a spatial map. In the spatial map, the dissimilar objects are far apart while objects which are similar are placed close to each other. In this survey article, MDS is described in comprehensive fashion by explaining the basic notions of classical MDS and how MDS can be helpful to analyze the multidimensional data. Later on, various special models based on MDS are described in a more mathematical way followed by comparisons of various MDS techniques.},
