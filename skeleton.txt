What's in the paper?

Background
  - What's the problem
  - Summary of literature
Method
  - Create a representation of the model
  - Algorithm in 2D
      - Parameters
      - Tuning
  - Showing model in high-d
  - What is learned about simulated examples
Applications
  - pbmc
     - NLDR view used to illustrate clusters
     - Use our method to assess is it a reasonable representation
     - Demonstrate that it is not
     - Illustrate how to use out method to get a better representation
   - digits: 1
     - NLDR is used to illustrate different ways 1's are drawn
     - Use our method to assess is it a reasonable representation
     - Demonstrate that it is, except for the anomalies
Discussion
  - Summarise contributions
  - Explain where it is expected or not expected to work, eg higher dimensional relationships
  - What might be useful enhancements
