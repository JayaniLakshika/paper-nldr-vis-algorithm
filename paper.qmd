  Nonlinear dimension reduction (NLDR) techniques such as tSNE, and UMAP provide a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional (high-D) data using non-linear transformation. The methods and parameter choices can create wildly different representations, making it difficult to decide which is best, or whether any or all are accurate or misleading. NLDR often exaggerates random patterns, sometimes due to the samples observed. But NLDR views have an important role in data analysis because, if done well, they provide a concise visual (and conceptual) summary of high-D distributions. To help evaluate the NLDR we have developed an algorithm to show the 2D NLDR model in the high-D space, viewed with a tour. One can see if the model fits everywhere or better in some subspaces, or completely mismatches the data. It is used to evaluate which 2D layout is the best representation of the high-D distribution and see how different methods may have similar summaries or quirks.

## Introduction

Non-linear dimension reduction (NLDR) is popular for making a convenient low-dimensional (\kD{}) representation of high-dimensional (\pD{}) data. Recently developed methods include t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) [@laurens2008], uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [@leland2018], potential of heat-diffusion for affinity-based trajectory embedding (PHATE) algorithm [@moon2019], large-scale dimensionality reduction Using triplets (TriMAP) [@amid2022], and pairwise controlled manifold approximation (PaCMAP) [@yingfan2021]. However, the representation generated can vary dramatically from method to method, and with different choices of parameters or random seeds made using the same method (@fig-NLDR-variety). The dilemma for the analyst is then, **which representation to use**. The choice might result in different procedures used in the downstream analysis, or different inferential conclusions. The research described here provides new visual tools to aid with this decision.

The paper is organised as follows. @sec-background provides a summary of the literature on NLDR, and high-dimensional data visualization methods. @sec-method contains the details of the new methodology, including simulated data examples. Two applications illustrating the use of the new methodology for bioinformatics and image classification are in @sec-applications. Limitations and future directions are provided in @sec-discussion.

## Background {#sec-background}

<!-- - Connection between NLDR and MDS-->
Historically, \kD{}   representations of \pD{}   data have been computed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) [@borg2005], which includes principal components analysis (PCA) [@jolliffe2011] as a special case.  The \kD{}   representation can be considered to be a layout of points in \kD{}   produced by an embedding procedure that maps the data from \pD{}. In MDS, the \kD{}   layout is constructed by minimizing a stress function that differences distances between points in \pD{}   with potential distances between points in \kD{}. Various formulations of the stress function result in non-metric scaling [@saeed2018] and isomap [@silva2002]. Challenges in working with high-dimensional data, including visualization, are outlined in @johnstone2009. 

Many new methods for NLDR have emerged in recent years, all designed to better capture specific structures potentially existing in \pD{}. Here we focus on five currently popular techniques, tSNE, UMAP, PHATE, TriMAP and PaCMAP. tNSE and UMAP can be considered to produce the \kD{}   minimizing the divergence between two distributions, where the distributions are modeling the inter-point distances. PHATE, TriMAP and PaCMAP are examples of diffusion processes [@coifman2005] spreading to capture geometric shapes, that include both global and local structure.

The array of layouts in @fig-NLDR-variety illustrate what can emerge from the choices of method and parameters, and the random seed that initiates the computation. Key structures interpreted from these views suggest: (1) highly **separated clusters** (a, b, e, g, h) with the number ranging from 3-6; (2) **stringy branches** (f), and (3) **barely separated clusters** (c, d) which would **contradict** the other representations. 

It happens because these methods and parameter choices provide different lenses on the interpoint distances in the data.

The alternative approach to visualizing the high-dimensional data is to use linear projections. PCA is the classical approach, resulting in a set of new variables which are linear combinations of the original variables. Tours, defined by @lee2021, broaden the scope by providing movies of linear projections, that provide views the data from all directions. @lee2021 provides an review of the main developments in tours. There are many tour algorithms implemented, with many available in the R package `tourr` [@wickham2011], and versions enabling better interactivity in `langevitour` [@harisson2024] and `detourr` [@hart2022]. Linear projections are a safe way to view high-dimensional data, because they do not warp the space, so they are more faithful representations of the structure. 
However, linear projections can be cluttered, and global patterns can obscure local structure. The simple activity of projecting data from \pD{}   suffers from piling [@laa2022], where data concentrates in the center of projections. NLDR is designed to escape these issues, to exaggerate structure so that it can be observed. But as a result NLDR can hallucinate wildly, to suggest patterns that are not actually present in the data. 

The solution is to use the tour to examine how the NLDR is warping the space. This approach follows what @wickham2015 describes as *model-in-the-data-space*. The fitted model should be overlaid on the data, to examine the fit relative the spread of the observations. While this is straightforward, and commonly done when data is 2D, it is also possible in \pD{}, for many models, when a tour is used. 

@wickham2015 provides several examples of models overlaid on the data in \pD{}. In hierarchical clustering, a representation of the dendrogrom using points and lines can be constructed by augmenting the data with points marking merging of clusters. Showing the movie of linear projections reveals shows how the algorithm sequentially fitted the cluster model to the data. For linear discriminant analysis or model-based clustering the model can be indicated by $(p-1)\text{-}D$ ellipses. It is possible to see whether the elliptical shapes appropriately matches the variance of the relevant clusters, and to compare and contrast different fits. For PCA, one can display the \kD{} plane of the reduced dimension using wireframes of transformed cubes. Using a wireframe is the approach we take here, to represent the NLDR model in \pD{}.

## Method {#sec-method}

### What is the NLDR model?

At first glance, thinking of NLDR as a modeling technique might seem strange. It is a simplified representation or abstraction of a system, process, or phenomenon in the real world. The \pD{}   observations are the realization of the phenomenon, and the \kD{}   NLDR layout is the simplified representation. From a statistical perspective we can consider the distances between points in the \kD{}   layout to be variance that the model explains, and the (relative) difference with their distances in \pD{}   is the error, or unexplained variance. We can also imagine that the positioning of points in \gD{}    represent the fitted values, that will have some prescribed position in \pD{}   that can be compared with their observed values. This is the conceptual framework underlying the more formal versions of factor analysis [@cfa69] and multidimensional scaling (MDS) [@borg2005]. (Note that, for this thinking the full \pD{}   data needs to be available, not just the interpoint distances.)
<!--### Notation -->

<!-- @tbl-notation summarises the notation used to explain the new methodology. The observed data is denoted as $\mathbfit{x}_{n \times p}$ where $x_{ij}$ would indicate the $i^{th}$ observation on the $j^{th}$ variable sampled from a population $\mathbfit{X}$. To refer to variable $j$, we would use $X_j$.--> 

<!--
$X_{n \times p} = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{x} _{1} & \textbf{x}_ {2} & \cdots & \textbf{x}_{n} \\  \end{bmatrix}^\top$

$Y_{n \times d} = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{y} _{1} & \textbf{y}_ {2} & \cdots & \textbf{y}_{n} \\  \end{bmatrix}^\top$

$C_k^{(2)} \equiv (C_{ky_1}, C_{ky_2})$

$C_k^{(p)} \equiv (C_{kx_1}, ..., C_{kx_p})$ $p$-D mappings of 2D hexagonal bin centroids of the $k^{th}$ hexagon

```

We define the NLDR as a function $g\text{:}~ \mathbb{R}^{n\times p} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$, with (hyper-)parameters $\mathbfit{\theta}$. The parameters, $\mathbfit{\theta}$, depend on the choice of $g$, and can be considered part of model fitting in the traditional sense. Common choices for $g$ include functions used in tSNE, UMAP, PHATE, TriMAP, PaCMAP, or MDS, although in theory any function that does this mapping is suitable. <!--Any input requirements for the data (such as normalization, or preprocessing through the use of PCA or similar) is considered part of the function $g$.-->

With our goal being to make a representation of this \gD{}    layout that can be lifted into high-dimensional space, the layout needs to be augmented to include neighbour information. A simple approach would be to triangulate the points and add edges. A more stable approach is to first hexagonally bin the data, reducing it from $n$ to $m\leq n$ observations, and connect the bin centroids. This process serves to reduce some noisiness in the resulting surface shown in \pD{}. The steps in this process are shown in @fig-NLDR-scurve, and documented below.

To illustrate the method, we use $7\text{-}D$ simulated data, which we call the "S-curve". It is constructed by setting $X_1 = \sin(a), X_2 = U(0, 2), X_3 = \text{sign}(a) \times (\cos(a) - 1), \forall a \in [-3\pi/2, 3\pi/2]$. The remaining variables $X_4, X_5, X_6, X_7$ are all uniform error, with small variance. We would consider $T=(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ to be the true model.

#### Scaling the data

It is beneficial to define the algorithm on data having a standard scale. Here the variables are scaled to [0, 1], but the upper bound can incorporate the aspect ratio produced by the NLDR $(r_1, r_2, ..., r_k)$, by setting them to $(y_{1,\text{max}}, y_{2,\text{max}}, ..., y_{k,\text{max}})$. When $k=2$ which is assumed for hexagon binning, $y_{1,\text{max}}=1$ and $y_{2,\text{max}} = \frac{r_2}{r_1}$, as observed in @fig-NLDR-scurve. <!-- \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. (The $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ accounts for the different height ($a_1$) and width ($a_2$) of a regular hexagon.) The scaling of data should take the size of the hexagons into account, but choice of number of bins should. -->

#### Computing hexagon grid configurations

The \gD{} hexagon grid is defined by the number of bins in each direction $(b_1, b_2)$, giving total number of bins as $b = b_1 \times b_2$, and hexagon id, $h = 1, \dots, b$. Each hexagon, $H_h$ is uniquely described by centroid, $C_{h}^{(2)} = (c_{h1}, c_{h2})$. The lower left position where the grid starts at $(s_1, s_2)$, which correspond to the lowest left centroid. The values of $s_i$ need to be below their respective minimum variable values, and could be a full bin lower, to allow a buffer ($q$) corresponding to a full hexagon width ($a_1$) and height ($a_2$) around the data. The values of $b_i$ are variables to be computed that define the reduction in size of the data ($n$ to $m$). 

The value for $b_2$ is computed by fixing $b_1$. Considering the lower bound of the NLDR, $a_1 > -2q$, and $a_1 > \frac{1+q}{b_1 -1}$. Similarly, according to the upper bound of the NLDR, $a_1 > \frac{2r_2(1 + q)}{\sqrt{3}(b_2 - 1)}$, because $a_2 = \frac{\sqrt(3)}{2}a_1$ for regular hexagons. Therefore, $b_2 = \Big\lceil1 +\frac{2r_2(b_1 - 1)}{\sqrt{3}}\Big\rceil$.

<!-- To define a hexagonal grid across the \kD{} space, with hexagons of fixed height ($a_1$), width ($a_2$),  it is necessary to determine how many hexagons should be represented along each axis in the \kD{} space.

When $k=2$, the number of bins along the $x$ and $y$ axes, $b_1$ and $b_2$, is computed by considering the scaling factors ${r_1, r_2}$, along with the offset along the axes ($q_1$, $q_2$), and the height ($a_1$) and width ($a_2$) of a regular hexagon (@fig-NLDR-scurve (b)). ($b_1 = \frac{r_1 + q_1}{a_2}$, and $b_2 = \frac{r_2 + q_2}{0.75 \times a_1}$) where $0.75 \times a_1$ accommodate to have hexagons fill the entire 2D space without leaving any gaps between them.)-->

<!-- XXX We don't need parameters for the regular hexagon, these are fixed constants. -->


#### Binning the data

<!-- Points are allocated to the bin they fall into based on the nearest centroid. In situations where a point is equidistant from multiple centroids, tie-breaking rules are applied. If multiple centroids are in the same row, the point is assigned to the leftmost centroid. If multiple centroids are in different rows, the point is assigned to the bottom centroid. -->

<!-- $\{ i \in H_h, h = 1, \dots, b, \text{ and } i = 1, \dots, n\}$ -->

We define the function $u: \mathbb{R}^{n\times 2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$, which generates the model by assigning the points to bin centroids.

For the $i^{th}$ point, $u(i) = \arg\min_{j = 1, \dots, b} \sqrt{(y_{i1} - C^{(2)}_{j1})^2 + (y_{i2} - C^{(2)}_{j2})^2}$, and falls in $H_h = \{i| u(i) = h\}$.

When $k = 2$, the hexagonal bin centroid is one representation of a bin (@fig-NLDR-scurve (c)). Additionally, it can be the mean of the points within each hexagon.

<!-- XXX How are you doing this? Do you check the bounds of the hexagon? Or do you use distance to centroid? -->

<!--
Define a hexagonal grid across the \kD{} space, using hexagons with fixed height ($a_2$), width ($a_1$). Each of the \kD{} points will belong to a hexagonal bin. That is, for each $y \in \mathbfit{Y}$, we can (uniquely) identify the hexagon that the point belongs to. This identification is done finding the nearest bin centroid for the \kD{} points by considering the \kD{} Euclidean distance.    

When $k=2$, the starting coordinates $(s_1, s_2)$ mark the lower left of the grid. This is the bottom left bin centroid. By starting from there, points are generated to fill the grid accounting $b_1$, $b_2$, $a_1$, and $a_2$. 
-->

<!--We deliberately separate out the creation of the hexagonal grid from the mapping of points on the grid.-->

#### Indicating neighbors by line segments connecting centroids

Delaunay triangulation [@lee1980] is used to connect neighboring centroids, which is needed to preserve neighborhood information when the model is lifted into \pD{}. 

<!-- When $k = 2$ Delaunay triangulation on $C^{(2)}$ generates the model in \gD{} space, which is a triangular mesh (@fig-NLDR-scurve (d)). It generates convex hulls of $C^{(2)}$ such that the circumcircle of every triangle in the triangulation contains no other points from $C^{(2)}$. -->

It can also happen that distant centroids can be connected, which can result in long line segments. In order to generate a smooth surface in \gD{}, these long line segments must be removed (@fig-NLDR-scurve (d)).

<!--need to add what is meant by a long edge-->

### Displaying the model in \pD{}

The last step is to lift the \kD{} model into \pD{} by computing \pD{} vectors that represent bin centroids. We use the \pD{} mean of the points in $H_h$ to map the centroid $C_{h}^{(2)} = (c_{h1}, c_{h2})$ to a point in \pD{}. Let the \pD{} mean be

$$C_{h}^{(p)} = \frac{1}{n_h}\sum_{i =1}^{n_h} x_i, h = {1, \dots, b; n_h > 0}.$$
Furthermore, line segments that exist in the \kD{} model generate line segments in \pD{} by connecting the \pD{} means of the corresponding \kD{} bin centroids.

### Measuring the fit {#sec-summary}
 <!-- Fitted values,  Error calculation-->
 
#### Fitted values

The fitted values of the points in $H_h$ refers to the \pD{} mapping $C_{h}^{(p)}$ of the corresponding \kD{} model point $C_{h}^{(2)}$. 

#### Error calculation

To assess how well our method captures and represents the underlying structure of the \pD{} data, residuals are important. Residuals are computed by taking the squared \pD{} Euclidean distance, $\sum_{h = 1}^{b}\sum_{i = 1}^{n_h}\sum_{j = 1}^{P} (x_{hij} - C^{(p)}_{hj})^2$. Additionally, Mean Squared Error (MSE), $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{h = 1}^{b}\sum_{i = 1}^{n_h}\sum_{j = 1}^{P} (x_{hij} - C^{(p)}_{hj})^2$, is computed based on residuals. 

### Prediction

The prediction approach involves finding the nearest \kD{} model point for a new \pD{} point. We define the function $z: \mathbb{R}^{n\times p} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$, where $z(i) = \arg\min_{j = 1, \dots, b} \sqrt{\sum_{v=1}^{P}(x_{iv} - C^{(p)}_{jv})^2}$ maps each \pD{} point to its nearest \pD{} mapping of the model. Therefore, the new observation $i$ falls in the hexagon, $H_h = \{i| z(i) = h\}$ and the corresponding \kD{} bin centroids, $C_{h}^{(2)} = (c_{h1}, c_{h2})$ be the predicted values.   

### Tuning
<!-- removal of low density bins, removing long edges, choice of bins-->

The performance and robustness of our model depend on three key parameters: (i) the total number of bins ($b$), (ii) a benchmark value used to remove low-density hexagons, and (iii) a benchmark value used to remove long edges. However, there is no analytical formula to calculate an appropriate value for these parameters. The selection of these parameter values depends on the model performance computed by MSE (see @sec-summary). 

#### Choice of bins

The number of hexagonal bins in the hexagonal grid has a considerable impact on the construction of the \gD{} model, serving as the initial step. The chosen total number of bins must effectively capture the structure of the NLDR data. If the number of bins is too low, the model may not be able to capture the structure of the NLDR data effectively (see @fig-bins-scurve (a)), while if there are too many bins, it may result in over-fitting the individual points of the NLDR data (see @fig-bins-scurve (c)). Therefore, it is important to determine an effective number of bins to construct a reasonable model (see @fig-bins-scurve (b)).

#### Removal of low density bins

Once setting up the hexagonal grid with an appropriate number of bins, some hexagonal bins may have few or no data points within them (see @fig-bins-scurve (b)). To ensure comprehensive coverage of the NLDR data, it is necessary to select hexagonal bins with a considerable number of data points. This involves calculating the number of points within each hexagon. Then, the standard count is computed by dividing the number of points within each hexagon by the maximum number of points in the grid. Next, bins with a standard count less than a benchmark value are removed (see @fig-lwd-scurve (a)). There is no specific rule for selecting a benchmark value. However, the following steps can help determine a suitable value for removing low-density hexagons:

1. Plot the distribution of the standardized counts (see @fig-stdcts-scurve).
2. Examine the distribution of counts.
3. Select the first quantile value if the distribution is skewed.

<!--add distribution of density and add the first quantile as the benchmark-->

The benchmark value for removing low-density hexagons ranges between $0$ and $1$. When analyzing how these benchmark values influence model performance, it's essential to observe the change in MSE as the benchmark value increases (see @fig-mse-scurve-lwd). The MSE shows a gradual increase as the benchmark value progresses from $0$ to $1$. Evaluating this rate of increase is important. If the increment is not considerable, the decision might lean towards retaining low-density hexagons.

Furthermore, selecting the benchmark value for removing low-density hexagons is important. Removing unnecessary bins may lead to the formation of long edges and an uneven \gD{} model. Hence, rather than solely relying on the benchmark value to identify hexagons for removal, it's essential to consider the standard number of points in the neighboring hexagons of the identified low-density bins (see @fig-lwd-scurve (b)). If neighboring bins also show low counts, only those bins will be removed. The remaining bins are used to construct the \gD{} model.

#### Removing long edges

To create a smooth \gD{} representation (see @fig-NLDR-scurve (d)), it is necessary to remove edges that connect distant bin centroids in the triangular mesh. These edges only exist in the \gD{} model and do not extend into \pD{}, so their removal does not impact the model in \pD{}. Although there are no specific criteria for determining the benchmark value to remove long edges, the following steps provide an approach to identifying a suitable threshold:

1. Plot the distribution of the 2D Euclidean distances (see @fig-dist-scurve).
2. Identify the first largest difference between consecutive distance values.
3. Take the distance value corresponding to this difference as the benchmark value.

<!--distribution of distance along with the default benchmark-->

## Illustration on simulated data

In this section, the effectiveness of the algorithm is described using a simulated dataset. The dataset consists of five spherical Gaussian clusters in $4\text{-}D$, with each cluster containing an equal number of points and the same within-cluster variation.

In the 2D layouts generated by various NLDR techniques, as shown in @fig-NLDR-variety-gau, five well-separated clusters are shown. In tSNE (see @fig-NLDR-variety-gau (a)), these clusters appear closely. UMAP arranges all clusters in a parallel manner, with three aligned in one line and the other two in a separate line (see @fig-NLDR-variety-gau (b)). In contrast, PHATE shows two closely positioned clusters and three more distant ones (see @fig-NLDR-variety-gau (c)). In TriMAP, two clusters are close, though not as tightly as PHATE, while the other three are well-separated (see @fig-NLDR-variety-gau (d)). Finally, PaCMAP shows one central cluster and the remaining four spread out in different directions (see @fig-NLDR-variety-gau (e)).

To investigate which is the reasonable representation to visualize the five spherical Gaussian cluster data or all NLDR methods provide equivalent information, we visualize all the models in \pD{} space. Models from all NLDR methods show five well-separated clusters (see @fig-gau1_sc, @fig-gau2_sc, @fig-gau3_sc, @fig-gau4_sc, and @fig-gau5_sc). This suggests that for the five Gaussian cluster dataset, all NLDR methods effectively preserve the global structure. tSNE displays clusters with varying densities, indicating their ability to capture within-cluster variation (see @fig-gau1_sc). On the other hand, both UMAP, PHATE, PaCMAP and TriMAP show clusters with flat surfaces, suggesting a failure to capture within-cluster variation (see @fig-gau2_sc, @fig-gau3_sc, @fig-gau4_sc and @fig-gau5_sc). Therefore, UMAP, PHATE, PaCMAP and TriMAP do not capture the local structure as effectively as other methods.

When compare the NLDR representations and generated models, tSNE with perplexity $61$ appears to be a reasonable representation for visualizing the five Gaussian cluster dataset. This is supported by investigating the model generated with tSNE in the data space, which provides evidence that it preserves both local and global structures. Also, the NLDR representation with tSNE shows five well-separated clusters.

In the field of single-cell studies, a common analytical task involves clustering to identify groups of cells with similar expression profiles. Analysts often turn to NLDR techniques to verify and identify these clusters and explore developmental trajectories. To illustrate the importance of NLDR techniques and parameter selection in identifying clusters, Human Peripheral Blood Mononclear Cells (PBMC3k) dataset [@chen2023] is used. In a study by @chen2023, this dataset was used to demonstrate how UMAP represents clusters (see @fig-umap-author). As shown in @fig-umap-author, there are three distant and well-separated clusters.

To determine whether the UMAP representation with the parameter choice suggested by @chen2023 preserves the original data structure, we visualize the model constructed with UMAP overlaid on the \pD{} data. The figures in @fig-pbmc1_sc show three well-separated clusters, indicating that the suggested UMAP representation preserves the global structure (see @fig-umap-author). However, as shown in @fig-pbmc1_sc, these clusters are close to each other in \pD{}. Also, non-linear continuity patterns and high-density patches within the clusters are observed (see @fig-pbmc1_sc). Therefore, the suggested UMAP representation (see @fig-umap-author) does not accurately preserve the local structure of the PBMC3k dataset.

In order to find a reasonable NLDR representation for the PBMC3k dataset, we calculated the absolute error for different numbers of non-empty bins using various NLDR techniques and different parameter settings (see @fig-pbmc-abserror). After analyzing the results, we found that tSNE with a perplexity set to $30$ had the lowest error when the number of non-empty bins was $137$. Therefore, tSNE with a perplexity of $30$, which is the default parameter setting, is considered as a reasonable representation for the PBMC3k dataset.

As shown in @fig-tsne-suggest, there are three well-separated clusters, although they are located close to each other. Additionally, non-linear structures can also be observed within the clusters (see @fig-model-pbmc (a)). In this manner, tSNE was able to capture the data structure for the PBMC3k dataset that UMAP failed to do.

We then fit the model for tSNE, and visualize the resultant model in the \pD{} data space. The model shows a quirk, as shown in @fig-pbmc2_sc. All three clusters are connected by an edge except the small and large clusters. Because the clusters are so close in \gD{}, they attempt to maintain the structure in \pD{} as well. This is evident that tSNE with perplexity $30$ provides a reasonable representation of PBMC3k data.

### digits: 1
<!--
- NLDR is used to illustrate different ways 1's are drawn
- Use our method to assess is it a reasonable representation
- Demonstrate that it is, except for the anomalies 
-->

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits [@lecun2010]. @yingfan2021 used this dataset to demonstrate how PaCMAP preserves local structure. We selected the \gD{} embedding of PaCMAP for the handwritten digit 1 to assess whether this is a reasonable representation using our method. As shown in @fig-pacmap-author-img, the angle of the digit 1 images varies along the \gD{} structure.

According to @fig-mnist1_sc1, the non-linear continuous structure observed in the \gD{} representation of PaCMAP (see @fig-pacmap-author) is also visible when visualizing the model overlaid on the data space. This indicates that PaCMAP accurately captures the structure of the \pD{} data. Additionally, the model shows a twisted pattern within the non-linear structure in \pD{} space (see @fig-mnist1_sc2), which is an additional pattern not visible in the \gD{} representation (see @fig-pacmap-author). Furthermore, as shown in @fig-mnist1_sc3, some long edges exist in the \pD{} space that are not recognized as long edges in the \gD{} representation. However, PaCMAP is a reasonable \gD{} representation of MNIST digit 1 data. Because PaCMAP preserves the local structure.

<!-- need to update the youtube recording-->

There are certain data points that exhibit high error rates due to their deviation from the usual \pD{} data structure, which makes them anomalies (see @fig-model-mnist (b)). These anomalies can be classified into two types: those that are anomalies within the non-linear structure and those that lie outside of it. The images associated with high model error points within the non-linear structure display different patterns of the digit 1, as shown in @fig-mnist-anomalies (a). However, when comparing these images to the ones found outside of the non-linear structure, it becomes evident that the latter display different patterns of the digit 1 (see @fig-mnist-anomalies (b)).

This study makes several important contributions to the field of NLDR. We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the most useful NLDR method and (hyper-)parameter choices for creating a reasonable \gD{} layout of high-dimensional data. Our objective is to fit a model for the \gD{} layout that preserves the relationships between neighboring points and turns it into a high-dimensional wireframe, which can be overlaid on the data and visualized using a tour. This approach is defined as *model-in-data-space*. Viewing a model in the data space is an ideal way to examine the fit.

The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through various examples. For instance, the S-curve example demonstrates how the model accurately fits the points, capturing both local and global structures in high-dimensional space. Our simulation case study further, five Gaussian cluster example shows that while all observed NLDR methods preserve the global structure, only tSNE effectively maintains the local structure, highlighting the specific strengths and quirks of different methods.

Human behavior often shows a desire for more certainty and a tendency to prefer well-separated views. This emphasizes the importance of clear and distinct clusters. For example, in the UMAP layout of the **pbmc** dataset suggested by @chen2023, three distant, well-separated clusters are shown. However, our model reveals that these clusters are actually close to each other in \pD{}. Additionally, the model discovers non-uniform data distribution and non-linear structures within the clusters that are not visible in the UMAP layout, demonstrating the ability of our model in uncovering hidden data characteristics.

Evaluating the error or unexplained variance is important for assessing how well the model fits the data. By examining the error for different numbers of bins, we found that tSNE with a perplexity of $30$ provides a reasonable representation for the **pbmc** dataset. Connecting the closest clusters with line segments in the fitted model further supports the preservation of neighborhood relationships.

The **digit: 1** example further illustrates the model's ability to accurately capture non-linear structures and provide additional information. Key findings include a twisted pattern that compresses the structure in some projections and long line segments that detect anomalies.

Predicting new observations in \kD{} is particularly valuable due to the limitations of some NLDR methods, like tSNE, which don't provide a straightforward method for prediction. As a result, our approach offers a solution that capable of generating predicted \kD{} embedding regardless of the NLDR method employed, effectively addressing this functional gap.

In conclusion, while our method effectively captures and represents high-dimensional data structures, further enhancements could involve introducing approaches to bind the data and indicate line segments beyond \gD{}. These improvements would help in creating a more accurate representation of the data when \gD{} layout is inadequate.
